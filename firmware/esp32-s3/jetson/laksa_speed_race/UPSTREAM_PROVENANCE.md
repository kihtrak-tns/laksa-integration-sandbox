## Rejected candidates

`Hamza-cpp/f1tenth_lab4_follow_the_gap` at
`226089379960ce7138d39acc626ff4feab9ee6c1` is an MIT lab skeleton with
unimplemented callbacks. `CL2-UWaterloo/f1tenth_ws` documents its own
`gap_follow` as incomplete. Neither is a valid source for a first-pass mapping
traversal under the no-new-algorithm rule.

`Ryan19941212/F1tenth` at `f2ffe5578effdc80bd5e27ff4bc4dc5be8ea77ca` is a
useful architecture reference, but the GitHub metadata did not provide a
license. It is not copied or included as a dependency.

## Verified simulator and controller integration

At the selected ref, Gym ROS publishes `/scan`, `/ego_racecar/odom`, and
`/ego_racecar/collision`, and accepts `ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped`
on `/drive`. Its bundled keyboard teleop is disabled by setting
`kb_teleop: false`; it is not a LAKSA competition dependency.

At the exact pin, Gym ROS rejects a custom vehicle name. The pinned Gym core,
however, exposes typed `VehicleParameters`, KS, RK4, Frenet lap counting and
`max_laps`. C1 uses a LAKSA-authored simulation-only ROS adapter as the sole
stepping authority. It contains no dynamics equations.

Waterloo Pure Pursuit is built unchanged mathematically. Its CMake/source
require `nav_msgs`, while its package manifest omits the dependency. The C1
runtime image adds only that manifest declaration before building.

For C1.2, the `nav2_regulated_pure_pursuit_controller` package is checked out
at the exact Navigation2 1.1.20 commit above and built externally. No Nav2
controller source is vendored or modified. The LAKSA host invokes the plugin
once per accepted stamped odometry state rather than using ControllerServer's
timer-driven authority model.

## License boundary

Gym and Pure Pursuit are MIT. Raceline-Optimization and the trajectory helpers
are LGPL-3.0. `quadprog==0.1.7` declares GPLv2+ and is confined to the
raceline-generation image. That image is not represented as Apache-only. No
upstream algorithm source is vendored into Project LAKSA.
